###  How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?

For each task in the assignment, I used function parameters to make the code more flexible. Using formatFullName, I passed firstName and lastName so that it could format any name input. In calculateTotalCost, I used price , quantity, and taxRate as parameters. 
Using parameters allowed the functions to be used for different situations without changing the actual code logic.

### What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?

A big challenge was making sure the conditional logic covered all possible inputs and edge cases. In checkEligibility I had to carefully check the conditions in the correct order (like age first, then employment status). 
James Lee actually took time out of his day to help me better understand the code and how to read it more efficiently. For calculateTotalCost, validating that all inputs were numbers and handling invalid or missing values required a lot of thought.

###  How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?

Refactoring improves readibility, cleaner code and avoid repeating the same logic multiple times. However with me applying the discount I was stuck. 
Knowing its small adjusments that needed to be, I was unabke to refractor it to my ability.
